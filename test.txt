Aries 
So much of what we do daily relies on passwords. They're all well and good until we forget one and experience delays and frustrations because we can't recall a single, crucial word or digit! Essential access to something becomes prohibited until we remember or retrieve the information. A Eureka Moment awaits you. Expect it to remove an unhelpful restriction and regain access to something you need. 

,Taurus 
It's natural to believe that seemingly significant problems require considerable attention and effort to resolve. But consider how many are resolved by doing less instead of more. You could see for yourself how doing less in some way can bring a better result. This new approach could also reduce your stress levels and boost your confidence at the same time. That makes it definitely worth trying. 

,Gemini 
Rarely, do we enjoy being pushed specific directions. We can also see restrictions as unhelpful if they require us to summon effort we believe to be unnecessary. However, it's possible you can become more productive and resourceful due to a restrictive influence in your world at this time. With a more open mind, you could find that what has been on par with wading through wet concrete becomes noticeably easier! 

,Cancer 
We can convince ourselves that a need to summon more effort to improve something can increase the likelihood of failure. However, it's worth considering the fact that whatever causes anxiety or nervousness in your world at this time could be a catalyst to a pleasing outcome. If you feel pushed in a particular direction, then go with that flow. It could be a direction you might not have headed toward otherwise. Trust that what's unfolding now is part of a much grander plan. 

,Leo
Second thoughts or reservations about pursuing a particular plan need to be pushed aside now. Don't be concerned that an important aspiration is gradually revealing itself to require more effort than you thought it would need. It's equally important that you don't convince yourself that you have nothing to show for your efforts, patience, and perseverance to date. You're in safe hands â€“ cosmically and otherwise! Trust that. 

,Virgo 
There are times when we believe we have a clear idea of how we should be rewarded for our efforts. This can be reinforced by the many times in our past when we were aware we invested considerable effort toward something and saw little or nothing in return. You mustn't convince yourself that you've wasted time and effort in some way now. As uncertain or unsettling as current circumstances might be, you look set to discover how connected they are to the next step or move you must take or make. 

,Libra 
The saying about 'seeing eye-to-eye' tends to mean two people agreeing with each other. But it's also something boxers do before a fight! Where you and a particular person haven't agreed about a specific matter, progress is about to be made. All that's needed is for the levels of self-interest on both sides to be pushed aside - and replaced with a shared willingness to see both sides of a story. 

,Scorpio 
A particular risk might appear daunting. However, does that not make it more intriguing? You appear to need to strike a balance between pursuing one specific plan or an idea with some degree of cautiousness while also accepting the benefits of throwing caution to the wind to see what it brings you. You can continue to play it safe indefinitely. But is the 'what if' aspect of what you're considering too strong to ignore? Hopefully, it is. 

,Sagittarius 
A particular discovery might not have you punching the air with joy. Although you might have one or two suspicions confirmed, any relief you feel could be outweighed by frustration. However, that's a brief synopsis of what appears to be unfolding in an area of your world. So, let's come back to that bit about 'relief.' What comes to light could point a clear way forward with something you've been unsure about the best way to tackle or resolve. That, as you're about to see, looks set to become a much-welcomed source of comfort. 

,Capricorn 
Don't be disheartened if you sense that progress in a particular area is similar to looking out of the window of a jumbo jet at the ground below. If you've ever done that, then you could believe that you're moving at a painfully slow speed. In truth, you're moving at hundreds of miles per hour which is why you mustn't concern yourself with a development you yearn to see happen that is taking too long. You're about to be reassured that patience you've summoned and applied diligently is paying off. 

,Aquarius 
When we hear a countdown, it is usually accompanied by a sense of anticipation or excitement. We can also feel some level of nervousness as well but push that aside now regarding something you're keen to experience or see happen. You're probably aware of what has been building momentum over some time, and a 'moment of truth' could be imminent. Prepare for lift-off! 

,Pisces 
Don't feel too resigned to believing that your happiness relies on the removal of particular obstacles. Chances are, much of what you're tolerating isn't of your making. If you're dealing with individuals who are slow to respond or require more effort on your part to remind them of why something should happen now rather than later, then you might need to accept that the ball is in their court for a little while longer. You've completed your side of a deal or bargain. Trust that somebody has no intention of letting you down.
